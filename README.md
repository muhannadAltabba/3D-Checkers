# 3D Checkers
<ul>
  <li>The checkers game is a college project for the third year. I used the standered rules of the game.You can change the type of play so you can play with a bot or another humen (on the same device or remotly).</li>
  <li>LThe interface is completely three-dimensional, based on coroutine for all movement operations (building board, moving pieces and switching roles between players).</li>
  <li>I added the feature Maximum Eat so that the player can in a certain situations eat more than one piece at a his role.</li>
  <li>I also added a pause menu that includes (help, restart, save, etc.).</li>
  <li>Finally, I added some simple animation Glowing Flying Dust to make the interface more attractive.</li>
